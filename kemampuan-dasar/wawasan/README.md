## Softtware Engineering
### History 
The term 'software engineering' was suggested at conferences organized by NATO in 1968 and 1969 to discuss the 'software crisis'. The software crisis was the name given to the difficulties encountered in developing large, complex systems in the 1960s. It was proposed that the adoption of an engineering approach to software development would reduce the costs of software development and lead to more reliable software.
1968: Nato conference on software engineering. Publication of Dijkstra's note on the dangers of the goto statement in programs.
Early 1970s. Development of the notions of structured programming. Publication of Parnas's paper on information hiding. Development of Pascal programming language. Development of Smalltalk languages which introduced notions of object-oriented development.
Late 1970s. Early use of software design methods such as Yourdon and Constantine's structured design. Development of first programming environments.
Early 1980s. Development of the Ada programming language which included notions of structured programming and information hiding. Proposals for software engineering environments. CASE tools introduced to support design methods. Development of algorithmic approaches to software costing and estimation. Publication of the 1st edition of this book as the first student textbook on software engineering.

### System Configuration Management (SCM) 
System Configuration Management is an arrangement of exercises which controls change by recognizing the items for change, setting up connections between those things, making/characterizing instruments for overseeing diverse variants, controlling the changes being executed in the current framework, inspecting and revealing/reporting on the changes made. It is essential to control the changes in light of the fact that if the changes are not checked legitimately then they may wind up undermining a well-run programming. In this way, SCM is a fundamental piece of all project management activities.

### Revision Control & Distributed version control
 revision control is any kind of practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code.Bugs or features of the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops). At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately. This simple approach has been used in many large software projects. While this method can work, it is inefficient as many near-identical copies of the program have to be maintained.Revision control may also track changes to configuration files, such as those typically stored in /etc or /usr/local/etc on Unix systems. This gives system administrators another way to easily track changes made and a way to roll back to earlier versions should the need arise.In 2010, software development author Joel Spolsky described distributed version control systems as "possibly the biggest advance in software development technology in the [past] ten years".

### GIT
 Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

### Set-up GIT & Check Version
Installing Git on Windows is not like Linux, where you type the command directly installed.
We have to download it first, then do the next> next> finish ritual.
But in this ritual, there are options that must be considered so that the git command can be recognized in CMD.
Download Git
Please go to the official Git website (git-scm.com). Then download Git according to our computer architecture. If using 64bit, download the 64bit. Likewise when using 32bit.
___
#### How to Install Git on Windows ,follow the steps below 
- open the git-$version.exe file
- Then the Git license information will appear, click Next> to continue
- Next, determine the installation location. Just leave it as it is, then click Next>
- Then select the components, just leave it like this and then click Next>
- Then select the directory, it's up to you to save the directory anywhere, click Next>
- Next, setting the PATH Environment. Select the middle one so that the git command can be recognized in the Command Prompt (CMD). After that click Next>
- Next change the finish line. Just leave it like this, then click Next>
- Next, the terminal emulator selection. Just select the bottom, then click Next>
- Next comes the selection of additional options. Just click Next>
- Then select the experimental option, just click Install to start the installation and Wait a few moments, the installation is being done. the last step click finish.

_to check the git version, open your terminal and enter the code "git --version."_
___
### Create account Github 
- first open the url [github!](https://github.com/)
- Enter the required ID ( Username ,email and password)
- Sign up for github
- then check the email you entered earlier for verification
- After email verification, github will redirect you to github.com, this indicates successful verification
___
### Creating a new repository in github
This url [Create New Repo!](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) describes how to create a repository.
